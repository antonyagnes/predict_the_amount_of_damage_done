Predict the amount of damage done to a building when an earthquake occurs - Supervised Learning 

The data set contains various details about aproximately 600000 buildings. Few features from the training set are as follows,

'area_assesed'<br />
'damage_grade'<br />
'district_id' <br />
'has_geotechnical_risk'<br />
'has_geotechnical_risk_fault_crack'<br />
'has_geotechnical_risk_flood'<br />
'has_geotechnical_risk_land_settlement'<br />
'has_geotechnical_risk_landslide'<br />
'has_geotechnical_risk_liquefaction'<br />
'has_geotechnical_risk_other'<br />
'has_geotechnical_risk_rock_fall'<br />
'has_repair_started'<br />
'vdcmun_id'<br />

I have used Random Forest to solve this problem. Using various other classifiers have given me a poor accuracy of less than 50% where as Random Forest Classifier has given me an accuracy of 70%.
