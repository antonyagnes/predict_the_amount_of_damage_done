Predict the amount of damage done to a building when an earthquake occurs - Supervised Learning 

The data set contains various details about aproximately 600000 buildings. Few features from the training set are as follows,

'area_assesed' 
'damage_grade'
'district_id' 
'has_geotechnical_risk'
'has_geotechnical_risk_fault_crack'
'has_geotechnical_risk_flood'
'has_geotechnical_risk_land_settlement'
'has_geotechnical_risk_landslide'
'has_geotechnical_risk_liquefaction'
'has_geotechnical_risk_other'
'has_geotechnical_risk_rock_fall'
'has_repair_started'
'vdcmun_id'

I have used Random Forest to solve this problem. Using various other classifiers have given me a poor accuracy of less than 50% where as Random Forest Classifier has given me an accuracy of 70%.
